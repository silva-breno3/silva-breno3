## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the **State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)**, building my path into the world of technology. My goal is to specialize in **Database Management** and **Information Security**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of cybersecurity through the **Ethical Hacking course** by Marcos Flávio Araújo Assunção.
- 👨‍💼 I have practical experience in team leadership and community management, having managed Discord teams for **FURIA Esports Communities** from early 2024 to mid-2025.
- 🐍 My academic journey has provided me with a foundational understanding of **Python**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My passion for esports and competitive gaming led me to my management role, and I still play **Counter-Strike** in my free time!
